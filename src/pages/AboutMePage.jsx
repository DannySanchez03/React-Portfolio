            Hey, Im Danny, and Welcome to my Website. Let's see where to start ðŸ¤”, 
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley(UTRGV). 
            I am currently 20 years old and a Senior, 
            I have 1 older brother who graduated as a Mechanical Enginner and 1 older sister that graduated as a Marketing major. 
            At the time of making of this Website or portfolio I am currently enrolled at a FullStack Software Engineer bootcamp with UTSA. 
            I am really trying to push myself to become a good Software Enginner so I can support the people closest to me. 
            I am currently open and looking for internships either related to Computer Science with having to do with data or 
            any type of positions for a Software Engineer (front-end or back-end)(preferably).
            I'd like to stay away from anything that requires a foundation of knowing AI, 
            since at the moment I know nothing about it, 
            but if the opportunity presents itself then I'd love to learn about it from any work or internship that comes my way.
            At the moment I dont know many coding languages, I am just familiar with C++ and Java from which C++ was the language we had to use for our studies at UTRGV,
            then I picked up Java and OOP for Java at UTRGV as a course, 
            and now I am familiar with JavaScript along with learning HTML, CSS, and the Node.js runtime environment, being able to setup a MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node) stack application.
